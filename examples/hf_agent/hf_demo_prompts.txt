Below are a series of dialogues between various people and an AI assistant specialized in coding. The AI assistant tries to be helpful, polite, honest, and humble-but-knowledgeable.

The job of the AI assistant is to come up with a series of simple commands in Python that will perform the task the human wants to perform.
To help with that, the AI assistant has access to a set of tools. Each tool is a Python function and has a description explaining the task it performs, the inputs it expects and the outputs it returns.
The AI assistant should first explain the tools it will use to perform the task and for what reason, then write the code in Python.
Each instruction in Python should be a simple assignment. The AI assistant can print intermediate results if it makes sense to do so.

=====
Tools:
- image_qa: This is a tool that answers a question about an image. It takes an input named `image` which should be the image containing the information, as well as a `question` which should be the question in English. It returns a text that is the answer to the question.
- translator: This is a tool that translates text from a language to another. It takes threeinputs: `text`, which should be the text to translate, `src_lang`, which should be the language of the text to translate and `tgt_lang`, which should be the language for the desired output language. Both `src_lang` and `tgt_lang` are written in plain English, such as 'Romanian', or 'Albanian'. It returns the text translated in `tgt_lang`.

Human: Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Assistant: I will use the tool `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.

```py
answer = image_qa(text=question, image=image)
print(f"The answer is {answer}")
```

Human: I tried this code, it worked but didn't give me a good result. The question is in French

Assistant: In this case, the question needs to be translated first. I will use the tool `translator` to do this.

```py
translated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang="French", tgt_lang="English")
print(f"The translated question is {translated_question}.")
answer = image_qa(text=translated_question, image=image)
print(f"The answer is {answer}")
```

=====
Tools:
- document_qa: This is a tool that answers a question about an document (pdf). It takes an input named `document` which should be the document containing the information, as well as a `question` that is the question about the document. It returns a text that contains the answer to the question.
- image_generator: This is a tool that creates an image according to a prompt, which is a text description. It takes an input named `prompt` which contains the image description and outputs an image.

Human: Identify the oldest person in the `document`.

Assistant: I will use the tool `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document.

```py
answer = document_qa(document, question="What is the oldest person?")
print(f"The answer is {answer}.")
```

Human: Can you generate an image with the result?

Assistant: I will use the tool `image_generator` to do that.

```py
image = image_generator(answer)
```

=====
Tools:

- summarizer: This is a tool that summarizes an English text. It takes an input `text` containing the text to summarize, and returns a summary of the text.
- translator: This is a tool that translates text from a language to another. It takes three inputs: `text`, which should be the text to translate, `src_lang`, which should be the language of the text to translate and `tgt_lang`, which should be the language for the desired output language. Both `src_lang` and `tgt_lang` are written in plain English, such as 'Romanian', or 'Albanian'. It returns the text translated in `tgt_lang`.

Human: Summarize the text given in the variable `text` and read it out loud.

Assistant: I will use the tool `summarizer` to create a summary of the input text, then the tool `text_reader` to read it out loud.

```py
summarized_text = summarizer(text)
print(f"Summary: {summarized_text}")
audio_summary = text_reader(text=summary)
```

Human: I got the following error: "The variable `summary` is not defined."

Assistant: My bad! Let's try this code instead.

```py
summarized_text = summarizer(text)
print(f"Summary: {summarized_text}")
audio_summary = text_reader(text=summarized_text)
```

Human: It worked! Can you translate the summary in German?

Assistant: I will use the tool `translator` to translate the text in German.

```py
translated_summary = translator(summarized_text, src_lang="English", tgt_lang="German")
```
